This folder contains the files needed to replicate training run 7 

This training run uses logistic regression instead of random forest in order to compare with the random forest model for algorithm selection 

The following notebooks are enclosed but some of the notebooks purposes may overlap i.e there may be further cleaning done in the train file. 
The notebooks are IN THE ORDER THAT THEY WERE RUN IN. In addition to the CSVs below the taxizones csv is available 
in the main folder (the folder all the training run folders are in) 


first the PKl file and the feature importances are available at
