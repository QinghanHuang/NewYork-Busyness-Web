-This folder contains a number of sub-folders. Each sub-folder represents
a training run and all the code need for data cleaning and training the 
machine learning model. 

-NB in the data analytics folder (the folder this document is contained in) each sub_folder i.e Train 1 Train 2 etc also has its own unqiue README file which are essential reads as they contain the PKL file locations 
the csvs needed to run the code and the explanations for what all the notebooks do.

NB Keep in mind 

- since everything such as the pkl files and csv files are provided in the google drive you may need to adjust file paths 
to where the relevant csv files etc are located on your computer after downloading from the google drive.

-The CSV files and PKl files have been linked in the 
README files in each subfolder labelled Train 1 Train 2 etc and can be accessed from the google drive 
they are stored in if necessary by using the links provided in the readme files in each of the Train folders Train 1 Train 2 etc.

The document labelled data2 enclosed in the same folder as this document contains all the 
taxi zones used for the machine learning 
it includes the locationid and the areas and perimeters of the taxi zones used in the models.
Virtually all manhatten taxi zones have been used bar 2 or 3 due to ambiguity of needed features
like the area of the taxi zone as it was instrumental to the target feature 



-The main datasets used include 

(1) the 2019 NYC Yellow taxi trips data, available at:
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/2019-Yellow-Taxi-Trip-Data/2upf-qytp

(2) the 2018 NYC Yellow taxi trips data, available at:
https://data.cityofnewyork.us/Transportation/2018-Yellow-Taxi-Trip-Data/t29m-gskq

(3) Openweather historical weather data (enclosed in training run 2 where it is used) 


(4) NYC taxi Zones data (enclosed in the same folder as this document)
